          Manila is the capital of the Philippines, and its second most populous city. It is highly urbanized and as of
          2019 was the world's most densely populated city proper.[11] It was the first chartered city in the country,
          designated as such by the Philippine Commission Act 183 of July 31, 1901. It became autonomous with the
          passage of Republic Act No. 409, "The Revised Charter of the City of Manila," on June 18, 1949.

          Coron is best known for world-class World War II-era wreck diving, the island also offers limestone karst
          landscapes, beautiful beaches, crystal-clear freshwater lakes, and shallow-water coral reefs.

          Coron is a separate group of islands from the main Palawan island. All of the islands here are part of the
          Calamian Archipelago in Northern Palawan. Often compared to El Nido, a popular Palawan destination, Coron has
          a unique charm of its own.
